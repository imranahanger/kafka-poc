# Kafka POC App

## Overview

This repository contains a proof-of-concept (POC) application demonstrating Kafka producer and consumer functionalities. The project structure includes folders for both the producer and consumer components, as well as a Docker Compose file for running a Kafka Docker container.

## Prerequisites

Before running the application, make sure you have the following installed:

- Docker
- Docker Compose

## Setup

1. Clone the repository:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/imranahanger/kafka-poc.git
    cd kafka-poc
    ```

2. Run the Kafka Docker container using Docker Compose:

    ```bash
    docker-compose up -d
    ```

## Producer

The `producer` folder contains the Kafka producer component. This component is responsible for generating and sending messages to the Kafka topic.

### Usage

To run the Kafka producer, navigate to the `producer` folder and execute the following command:

```bash
npm install
node app.js
```

## Consumer

The `consumer` folder contains the Kafka consumer component. This component subscribes to the Kafka topic and processes incoming messages.

### Usage

To run the Kafka consumer, navigate to the `consumer` folder and execute the following command:

```bash
npm install
node app.js
```

## Docker Compose

The `docker-compose.yml` file defines the services needed for running Kafka in a Docker container. To start the Kafka container, run the following command from the project root:

```bash
docker-compose up -d
```

To stop the Kafka container, use:

```bash
docker-compose down
```

## Notes

- Ensure that your Kafka container is running before executing the producer and consumer components.
- Customize the producer and consumer scripts based on your specific use case.
